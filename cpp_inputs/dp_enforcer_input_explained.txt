##############
T: time horizon
X: number of different costs
eps: DP threshold
alpha: minimum viable acceptance rate, default value 0
beta: maximum viable acceptance rate, default value 1

If alpha = 0 and beta = 1, the specification is normal DP. Also, it happens that DP < beta - alpha.

buff_gAacc, buff_gAseen, buff_gBacc, buff_gBseen are values to be added to the DP. If they are non-zero, the specification is of the type "buffered DP". Default value is 0 for all.

N_i is the i-th index cost. The costs are floats, but there is a discrete number of different costs (given by X).

Prob_G_acc_i is the probability that an instance comes from Group G, the ML classifier proposes accept, and the cost of changing such decision is N_i.

Prob_G_rej_i is the probability that an instance comes from Group G, the ML classifier proposes reject, and the cost of changing such decision is N_i.

Prob_G_rej_1 + ... + Prob_G_rej_X = Prob(reject, Group = G)
Prob_G_acc_1 + ... + Prob_G_acc_X = Prob(accept, Group = G)

Prob(reject, Group = G) + Prob(accept, Group = G) = Prob(Group = G)

Prob(Group = A) + Prob(Group = B) = 1
